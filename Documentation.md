# ðŸš€ ClusteredData Warehouse API Documentation

ClusteredData Warehouse exposes a powerful API for handling Foreign Exchange (FX) deals. This documentation details the `/api/XFDeals` endpoint, its input structure, validation, error handling, and deployment using Docker.

## API Endpoint

### Endpoint:
- **[POST] http://localhost:8082/api/XFDeals**

### Request JSON Example:
```json
{
    "id": "1224JNKJR",
    "orderingCurrencyIsoCode": "CODE123",
    "toCurrencyIsoCode": "CODE321",
    "dealAmount": 8500.99
}

## Request Validation

The endpoint performs field validation using Jakarta Validation annotations. Any invalid field triggers a structured error message handled by the `GlobalExceptionHandler` REST Controller Advice, responding with HTTP status `BAD_REQUEST`.

## Database Interaction

- If the FX deal with the specified `id` does not exist in the Postgres database:
  - The object is inserted.
  - The inserted object is returned.

- If the FX deal with the specified `id` already exists in the database:
  - An exception is thrown.
  - The exception is caught and handled by the `GlobalExceptionHandler` class.
  - The response includes a structured error message with HTTP status `BAD_REQUEST`.

## Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) Logging

AspectJ is utilized for AOP logging to capture parameters passed to service methods. This includes logging successful executions and errors, providing comprehensive insights.

## Testing

- **JUnit 5:**
  - The project employs JUnit 5 for unit testing.
  - Extensive test coverage ensures robustness, achieving 100% coverage.

- **Mockito:**
  - Mockito is utilized for efficient mocking in unit tests.

## Dockerization

The application is Dockerized using a multi-stage Dockerfile, optimizing the Docker image size and ensuring efficient deployment.

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is employed to orchestrate the deployment of two services:
- The Spring Boot application [PORT 8082].
- Postgres 15, serving as the database [PORT 5432].

## Running the Application

make run

# Run Docker Compose (detached)
make run-detached

#Access the API:
The API is now accessible at http://localhost:8080/api/XFDeals.
